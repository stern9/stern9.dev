                    I made my first personal site back on 2013, it was a static
                    build hosted on Github and to be honest not that great. But
                    hey we have to start somewhere right? - if you want to see

                    built with some of the technologies I've been working on
                    recently - NextJS styled using TailwindCSS with a couple of
                    API's used to connect social media information. All images
                    are of my personal/work projects - svg icons are a
                    combination of react-icons and heroicons. Hosted on a web
                    server also built by me using Express, NodeJS and Nginx on a
                    cloud machine running on Ubuntu.

                    TypeScript, React Native, Docker and more about how the

                    a try and of course continue with JavaScript - you can never
                    stop learning about this wonderful and complex programming
                    language.

                    I linked the Spotify API to this site, below you can see my
